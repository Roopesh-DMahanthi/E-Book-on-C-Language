Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.

C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.

C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.

S.N.	Statement & Description
1	if statement
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.

2	if...else statement
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.

3	nested if statements
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).

4	switch statement
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.

5	nested switch statements
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).

The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form -

Exp1 ? Exp2 : Exp3;
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.

The value of a ? expression is determined like this -

Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.

If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.
